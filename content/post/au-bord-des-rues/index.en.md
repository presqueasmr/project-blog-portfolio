**Au Bord des Rues** is a blog **development** and **web writing** project about solidarity in Bordeaux. 
I took part in the writing of an **article**, the **back-end development** in PHP with an SQL database and the **designing** of the website. We were 5 in the Nebulab team.

**Technologies and tools used:**
  
* PHP
* mySQL
* phpMyAdmin (local Apache server)
* GitHub 
* Figma 
* Trello

**N.B.:** The project was hosted on the server of the IUT and is no longer available online.
