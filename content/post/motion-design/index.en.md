## Objectives

We had **2 weeks** by **groups of 2**, to imagine, conceive and add sound to a motion design with the purpose to **vulgarize a sociological theory of William I. Thomas**. We learned how to create moodboards, storyboard and script our short film. It was also our first approach to After Effects. We opted for the absurd fusion of the Harry Potter and Star Wars universes in order to capture the audience's attention while remaining humorous.

## Tools used:

* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* After Effects
* Premiere Pro
