## Objectives

In groups of 5 we were had to create an interactive experience on the occasion of the Bacchanight student event at the Fine Arts Museum of Bordeaux. We chose to develop a fighting game in HTML/CSS/JS vanilla *mobile-first*. I took part in the character design and sprite sheet as well as in the annimation of the characters with After Effects.

## Story

On the evening of the Bacchanight, the curator of the museum receives a threatening letter mentioning a "candle". She does not understand right away what it refers to , however the other paintings of the museum immediately grasp the greatness of the threat. Indeed a jealous painter menaces the flame of a caravaggio painting : MAITRE A LA CHANDELLE, "Saint Sebastian cared by Irene". A lute player from a Dutch painting then decides to leave his painting to defeat this terrible threat.
