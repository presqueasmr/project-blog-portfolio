## Objectives

One of the most important projects of the year in MMI is called the **Workshop**. The goal is to design a digital solution that is **useful and ethical**, in order to respond to a social issue (health, politics, education...). In **groups of 12**, we imagined, designed and developed the **Bouillotte et Culotte** website and a digital marketing strategy around the project. Following our research, we realized that endometriosis is a very common disease, affecting women of all ages ( in France 1 woman in 10 is affected according to the INSERM) with a very important diagnostic errancy. We therefore decided to create a website (mobile-first) to raise awareness of endometriosis among young and very young girls, hoping to break a taboo. With my team, I was in charge of the **front-end development** and the **content creation** (**research** and **interviews** of several relatives and women with endometriosis).
