## Objectives

We participated in the **hackathon** organized by Reboot!. Over **3 days**, our goal was to create a tool for communication, marketing or digital responsibility. The topic was **"Here and now "**. Noting from our experience the **lack of information on ecoconception**, we chose to treat the topic for the hackathon. The site gathers conversations we had with several professionals expert in web ecoconception. The site aims to serve as an interface and resource for amateurs and professionals looking to learn about responsible ways to create on the web. With my team, I was in charge of the **content writing** and the **interviews**. I also provided assistance to the **development team**.
