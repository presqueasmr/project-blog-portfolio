## Objectives

We had **2 weeks** to imagine and design a video game on the subject : **Présent composé - Plus que passé - Futur imparfait**. We decided to create a **narrative platform game** on the theme of the **mother-daughter relationship**, which was very close to our hearts. In our group of **5 people**, I was in the **art direction**, **illustrations** and **game design** team (I also participated in the writing of the script). 

## Tools used :

* Unity - C#
* Photoshop & Illustrator
* Notion
