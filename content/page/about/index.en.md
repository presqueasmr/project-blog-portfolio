**I hope you enjoy my work so far !**

As you may know my name is Auriane-Mirana SICARD-RAZAKA (I am part french part malagasy hence the endless name :'))
Since 2021 I bounce back and forth between Bordeaux and Lyon, to study at the Bordeaux Montaigne IUT in the MMI branch (Métiers du Multimédia et de l'Internet). This year my ultimate goal is to get an **internship from April, 17th to June, 30th**, and possibly an **apprenticeship** next year (2023-2024).

Besides my passion for digital creation, I am overall a thourough enthusiast of creation in all its aspects (music, drawing, cinema, video games...)
